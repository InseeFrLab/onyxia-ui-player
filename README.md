This project is intended to generate a succession of animated text Onyxia-ui themed.  
It's intended use is to record videos for creating catchy trailers to share on social networks.

This tools will only generate a web app. In order to turn it into a video you'll have
to record the screen and then you are on your own to edit the video.  

The `animation` param refers to [animate.css](https://animate.style/) class names.

Side tools that I use:  
- [VN](https://www.vlognow.me/): A very simple and free to use video editor software.  
- [Rotato](https://rotato.app/) (MacOS only): A tool to generate 3D rendered device playing your screen cap.
